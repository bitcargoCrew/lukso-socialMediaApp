# Getting Started

## General architecture

![Architecture](./frontend/public/fundraising.drawio.png "Architecture")

We store private data in our encrypted private database, for example, the data from the chat app and the information from the private groups. Other general information that needs to be public and traceable is stored in the Lukso blockchain via a smart contract transaction. This secures all private data, while the activities from the fundraising process can be tracked publicly.

We use the following parts of the Lukso Blockchain:

- Integration of Universal Profiles (UPs) for the Login
- Show the assets of a UP in the application
- Send LXYe token between UPs
- Send a token (LSP7) to another UP
- Send a NFTs (LSP8) to another UP
- Token-based access to a private group
- Use LXYe tokens to fund a campaign (fundraising campaign)
- Interaction with UniversalPage to mint tokens and NFTs

## Smart contract

Our smart contract is developed and tested in [here](/smartcontract)
